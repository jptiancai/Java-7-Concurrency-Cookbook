- 测试

Testing an application is a critical task. Before the application is ready for end users, you
have to demonstrate its correctness. You use a test process to prove that correctness
is achieved and errors are fixed. The testing phase is a common task in any software
development and also quality assurance processes. You can find a lot of literature about
testing processes and the different approaches you can apply to your developments. There
are also a lot of libraries, such as  JUnit , and applications, such as Apache  JMetter that
you can use to test your Java applications in an automated way. It's even more critical in a
concurrent application development


The fact that concurrent applications have two or more threads that share data
structures and interact with each other adds more difficulty to the testing phase.
The biggest problem you will face when you test concurrent applications is that the
execution of threads is non-deterministic. You can't guarantee the order of the execution
of the threads, so it's difficult to reproduce errors.

## Configuring Eclipse for debugging concurrency code


- 默认是指暂停你断点的线程,其他线程照样跑,如果你想到达断点的时候,其他线程也都暂停,采取以下措施:

Change the value of the Default suspend policy for new breakpoints from Suspend
Thread to Suspend VM (marked in red in the screenshot).

You can see that only the worker-21 is suspended (marked in red in the screenshot) while
the rest of the threads are running. However, if you change Default suspend policy for new
breakpoints to Suspend VM, all the threads suspend their execution while you're debugging
a concurrent application and the debug process hits a breakpoint. The following screenshot
shows an example of this situation:

## Testing concurrency code with MultithreadedTC

MultithreadedTC is a Java library for testing concurrent applications. Its main objective is to
solve the problem of concurrent applications being non-deterministic. You can't control their
order of execution. For this purpose, it includes an internal metronome to control the order
of execution of the different threads that form the application. Those testing threads are
implemented as methods of a class.
In this recipe, you will learn how to use the MultithreadedTC library to implement a test for

In this recipe, you have implemented a test for the  LinkedTransferQueue class using the
MultithreadedTC library. You can implement a test to any concurrent application or class using
this library and its metronome. In the example, you have implemented the classical producer/
consumer problem with two consumers and a producer. You want to test that the first  String
object introduced in the buffer is consumed by the first consumer that arrives at the buffer
and the second  String object introduced in the buffer is consumed by the second consumer
that arrives at the buffer.


The MultithreadedTC library is based on the JUnit library, which is the most often used library
to implement unit tests in Java. To implement a basic test using the MultithreadedTC library,
you have to extend the  MultithreadedTestCase class. This class extends the  junit.
framework.AssertJUnit class that includes all the methods to check the results of the
test. It doesn't extend the  junit.framework.TestCase class, so you can't integrate the
MultithreadedTC tests with other JUnit tests.


To control the order of execution of threads, you use the  waitForTick() method. This
method receives an  integer type as a parameter and puts the thread that is executing
the method to sleep until all threads that are running in the test are blocked. When they are
blocked, the MultithreadedTC library resumes the threads that are blocked by a call to the
waitForTick() method.


The integer you pass as a parameter of the  waitForTick() method is used to control the
order of execution. The metronome of the MultithreadedTC library has an internal counter.
When all the threads are blocked, the library increments that counter to the next number
specified in the  waitForTick() calls that are blocked.


Internally, when the MultithreadedTC library has to execute a test, first it executes the
initialize() method. Then, it creates a thread per method that starts with the  thread
keyword (in your example, the methods  thread1() ,  thread2() , and  thread3() ) and when
all the threads have finished their execution, it executes the  finish() method. To execute
the test, you have used the  runOnce() method of the  TestFramework class


- 如果死锁发生了会怎么办?

If the MultithreadedTC library detects that all the threads of the test are blocked, but none
of them are blocked in the  waitForTick() method, the test is declared to be in a deadlock
state and a  java.lang.IllegalStateException exception is thrown.
