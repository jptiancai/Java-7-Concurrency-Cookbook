## 更高层的机制

- `Semaphores`: A semaphore is a counter that controls the access to one or
more shared resources. This mechanism is one of the basic tools of concurrent
programming and is provided by most of the programming languages.
- `CountDownLatch`: The  CountDownLatch class is a mechanism provided by the Java
language that allows a thread to wait for the finalization of multiple operations.
- `CyclicBarrier`: The  CyclicBarrier class is another mechanism provided by the
Java language that allows the synchronization of multiple threads in a common point.
- `Phaser`: The  Phaser class is another mechanism provided by the Java language that
controls the execution of concurrent tasks divided in phases. All the threads must
finish one phase before they can continue with the next one. This is a new feature of
the Java 7 API.
- `Exchanger`: The  Exchanger class is another mechanism provided by the Java
language that provides a point of data interchange between two threads.

Semaphores are a generic synchronization mechanism that you can use to protect any critical
section in any problem. The other mechanisms are thought to be used in applications with
specific features as it was described previously. Be sure to select the appropriate mechanism
according to the characteristics of your application.

## Controlling concurrent access to a resource

- Main.java

```java
/**
 * Main class of the example.
 *
 */
public class Main {

	/**
	 * Main method of the class. Run ten jobs in parallel that
	 * send documents to the print queue at the same time.
	 */
	public static void main (String args[]){
		
		// Creates the print queue
		PrintQueue printQueue=new PrintQueue();
		
		// Creates ten Threads
		Thread thread[]=new Thread[10];
		for (int i=0; i<10; i++){
			thread[i]=new Thread(new Job(printQueue),"Thread "+i);
		}
		
		// Starts the Threads
		for (int i=0; i<10; i++){
			thread[i].start();
		}
	}

}
```

- Job.java

```java
/**
 * This class simulates a job that send a document to print.
 *
 */
public class Job implements Runnable {

	/**
	 * Queue to print the documents
	 */
	private PrintQueue printQueue;
	
	/**
	 * Constructor of the class. Initializes the queue
	 * @param printQueue
	 */
	public Job(PrintQueue printQueue){
		this.printQueue=printQueue;
	}
	
	/**
	 * Core method of the Job. Sends the document to the print queue and waits
	 *  for its finalization
	 */
	@Override
	public void run() {
		System.out.printf("%s: Going to print a job\n",Thread.currentThread().getName());
		printQueue.printJob(new Object());
		System.out.printf("%s: The document has been printed\n",Thread.currentThread().getName());		
	}
}
```

- PrintQueue.java

```java
/**
 * This class implements the PrintQueue using a Semaphore to control the
 * access to it. 
 *
 */
public class PrintQueue {
	
	/**
	 * Semaphore to control the access to the queue
	 */
	private final Semaphore semaphore;
	
	/**
	 * Constructor of the class. Initializes the semaphore
	 */
	public PrintQueue(){
		semaphore=new Semaphore(1);
	}
	
	/**
	 * Method that simulates printing a document
	 * @param document Document to print
	 */
	public void printJob (Object document){
		try {
			// Get the access to the semaphore. If other job is printing, this
			// thread sleep until get the access to the semaphore
			semaphore.acquire();
			
			Long duration=(long)(Math.random()*10);
			System.out.printf("%s: PrintQueue: Printing a Job during %d seconds\n",Thread.currentThread().getName(),duration);
			Thread.sleep(duration);			
			TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(duration);
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		} finally {
			// Free the semaphore. If there are other threads waiting for this semaphore,
			// the JVM selects one of this threads and give it the access.
			semaphore.release();			
		}
	}

}
```

- 输出结果: 同样是打印机,这次使用Semaphors来实现,和ReentrantLock类似,都有公平和非公平模式

- Semaphors的构造参数是1的原因?

Another important point in this example is the constructor of the  PrintQueue class and
the initialization of the  Semaphore object. You pass the value  1 as the parameter of this
constructor, so you are creating a binary semaphore. The initial value of the internal counter
is  1 , so you will protect the access to one shared resource, in this case, the print queue.
When you start the 10 threads, the first one acquires the semaphore and gets the access to
the critical section. The rest are blocked by the semaphore until the thread that has acquired
it, releases it. When this occurs, the semaphore selects one of the waiting threads and gives it
the access to the critical section. All the jobs print their documents, but one by one.

## Controlling concurrent access to multiple copies of a resource

public class Main {

	/**

	 * send documents to the print queue at the same time.
	 */
	public static void main (String args[]){
		
		// Creates the print queue
		PrintQueue printQueue=new PrintQueue();
		
		// Creates ten Threads
		Thread thread[]=new Thread[12];
		for (int i=0; i<12; i++){
			thread[i]=new Thread(new Job(printQueue),"Thread "+i);
		}
		
		// Starts the Threads
		for (int i=0; i<12; i++){
			thread[i].start();
		}
	}

}
```

public class Job implements Runnable {

	/**
	 * Queue to print the documents
	 */
	private PrintQueue printQueue;
	
	/**
	 * Constructor of the class. Initializes the queue
	 * @param printQueue
	 */
	public Job(PrintQueue printQueue){
		this.printQueue=printQueue;
	}
	
	/**

	}
	
	public void printJob (Object document){

	private int getPrinter() {
		int ret=-1;
		
		try {
			// Get the access to the array
			lockPrinters.lock();
			// Look for the first free printer
			for (int i=0; i<freePrinters.length; i++) {
				if (freePrinters[i]){
					ret=i;
					freePrinters[i]=false;
					break;
				}
			}
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		} finally {
			// Free the access to the array
			lockPrinters.unlock();
		}
		return ret;
	}

}
```

- 输出结果: 多台打印机打印多个文件的情况怎么办? 这里用Semaphore + ReentrantLock 来实现

 But semaphores can also be used when
you need to protect various copies of a resource, or when you have a critical section that can
be executed by more than one thread at the same time.

- CountDownLatch具体用法

The Java concurrency API provides a class that allows one or more threads to wait until a
set of operations are made. It's the  CountDownLatch class. This class is initialized with an
integer number, which is the number of operations the threads are going to wait for. When
a thread wants to wait for the execution of these operations, it uses the  await() method.
This method puts the thread to sleep until the operations are completed. When one of these
operations finishes, it uses the  countDown() method to decrement the internal counter of the  CountDownLatch class. When the counter arrives to  0 , the class wakes up all the
threads that were sleeping in the  await() method.


The  CountDownLatch class has three basic elements:

- The initialization value that determines how many events the  CountDownLatch class waits for
- The  await() method, called by the threads that wait for the finalization of all the events
- The  countDown() method, called by the events when they finish their execution

When you create a  CountDownLatch object, the object uses the constructor's parameter
to initialize an internal counter. Every time a thread calls the  countDown() method, the
CountDownLatch object decrements the internal counter in one unit. When the internal
counter arrives to  0 , the  CountDownLatch object wakes up all the threads that were waiting
in the  await() method.
There's no way to re-initialize the internal counter of the  CountDownLatch object or to modify
its value. Once the counter is initialized, the only method you can use to modify its value is
the  countDown() method explained earlier. When the counter arrives to  0 , all the calls to the
await() method return immediately and all subsequent calls to the  countDown() method
have no effect.
There are some differences with respect to other synchronization methods, which are
as follows:

- The  CountDownLatch mechanism is not used to protect a shared resource or a critical section. It is used to synchronize one or more threads with the execution of various tasks.
- It only admits one use. As we explained earlier, once the counter of CountDownLatch arrives at  0 , all the calls to its methods have no effect. You have to create a new object if you want to do the same synchronization again.
